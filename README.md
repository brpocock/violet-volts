Violet Volts
============

Violet Volts is an MMO-RPG being developed as a proof-of-concept and
playable demo of the Romance game system.

The game itself is a fantasy world in which colourful tortoises can explore,
build things, et al.

The major efforts presently are focused on the Romance II core and the
Parenthetical web-based client.

You might fork Violet Volts if you intend to create your own MMO-RPG.
