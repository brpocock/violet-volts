This is the manual for the tootstest server for Violet Volts.

@section Who are Violet Volts?

Violet Volts is  the project responsible for the  current development of
the Romance Ⅱ Game System, particularly, for the flagship implementation
of it in the form of Tootsville Ⅴ.

Note that Violet Volts is an anagram for Tootsville Ⅴ.


@section What is Tootsville?

Tootsville was  the flagship product  which helped develop  the original
Romance game system into such  a powerful suite. Its commercial sponsor,
Res  Interactive,   LLC,  was  later   shut  down  for   legal  reasons.
The resurrected game  (with the permission of several  of Res's managing
members) is now the flagship for the ongoing development of Romance Ⅱ.
